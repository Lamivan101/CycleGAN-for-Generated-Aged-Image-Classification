# CycleGAN-for-Generated-Aged-Image-Classification
## Introduction
As humans age, their appearances undergo complex changes. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin leads to a flabby or drooping face. Skin dryness and shrinking of the underlying fat layer result in a loss of the plump, smooth surface and the emergence of wrinkles. These transformations can significantly impact face recognition, especially if the records of the targetâ€™s photos have not been updated for years, leading to inaccuracy. Recognizing the complexity of this issue, our project aims to delve deep into this phenomenon and develop a model that can accurately predict the appearance of an aged person from their young appearance, thereby enhancing face recognition.
